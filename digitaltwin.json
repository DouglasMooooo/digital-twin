        {
          "question": "Walk me through how you would design a RAG system for a customer service chatbot",
          "answer": "I'd start with data ingestion - collecting and cleaning customer service documentation, FAQs, and historical tickets. Next, chunk the documents appropriately (I typically use 500-1000 token chunks with 10% overlap). Generate embeddings using a model like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and store in a vector database like Upstash Vector for production or ChromaDB for development. For retrieval, implement semantic search with hybrid scoring (vector similarity + keyword matching) to fetch top-k relevant chunks. The generation layer uses an LLM (like Groq's Llama models for speed) with retrieved context in the prompt. Key considerations: implement relevance filtering to avoid hallucinations, add source citations, cache common queries, and monitor query latency. I built this exact architecture for my digital twin project with <2s response times."
        },
        {
          "question": "How would you approach data quality issues in a business analytics project?",
          "answer": "From my experience at BF Suma dealing with inventory data: First, profile the data to identify issues - missing values, outliers, inconsistencies. Document data quality metrics (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness). For correction: establish data validation rules at entry points, implement automated cleaning scripts (Python/Pandas), create exception reporting dashboards in Power BI. Most importantly, work with source teams to fix root causes - I reduced inventory variance from 15% to <3% by addressing warehouse process issues, not just fixing data downstream. Always balance automation with business context validation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Explain your experience with version control and CI/CD",
          "answer": "I use Git/GitHub for all projects with structured branching (main/develop/feature branches). For my digital twin project, implemented GitHub Actions for CI/CD: automated testing runs on pull requests, linting checks for code quality, automated deployment to Vercel on main branch merges. This ensures every deployment is tested and maintains code quality standards. Also use semantic commit messages and maintain comprehensive README documentation for team collaboration. While I'm still building experience with large team workflows, I understand the importance of code review processes and maintaining clean commit history."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you ensure your AI/ML models don't produce biased or inappropriate results?",
          "answer": "Multiple approaches: 1) Prompt engineering - carefully design system prompts with guardrails and ethical guidelines. 2) Context filtering - ensure retrieved RAG context is relevant and appropriate. 3) Output validation - implement content moderation checks. 4) Testing across diverse scenarios - I tested my digital twin with various interview types to ensure balanced responses. 5) Human-in-the-loop - especially for production systems, maintain review processes. 6) Monitoring - log all queries and responses to identify patterns of problematic outputs. Also stay updated on AI ethics best practices and platform-specific guidelines."

            "2. Communicate immediately: Inform stakeholders (manager, presentation owner) about the issue and estimated fix timeline",
            "3. Debug systematically: Check logs, trace data flow, isolate the failure point",
            "4. Implement fix: Apply correction, test thoroughly with sample data before full pipeline run",

          "question": "How would you approach mentoring a junior team member who is struggling with their tasks?",
          "approach": "First, have 1-on-1 conversation to understand specific challenges - is it technical skills, time management, or unclear requirements? Create supportive environment where they feel comfortable asking questions. Then: pair programming sessions to demonstrate problem-solving approach, share relevant resources/documentation, break down complex tasks into manageable steps, set up regular check-ins to track progress. Focus on teaching problem-solving methods rather than just solutions. I've done this informally during bootcamp peer reviews and when training local staff at BF Suma - key is patience and adapting explanation style to their learning preferences."

          "question": "Your manager wants to implement a new AI tool but you have concerns about data privacy. How do you handle this?",

Research the tool's data handling policies, security certifications, compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, etc.). Propose risk mitigation strategies: data anonymization, on-premise deployment options, vendor security audit requirements. Present alternative tools if available that meet requirements with better privacy controls. Document all considerations for decision-making transparency. Balance innovation enablement with responsible data stewardship. From my ERP testing experience at BF Suma, learned importance of thorough evaluation before system adoption."
