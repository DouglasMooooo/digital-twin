# Douglas Mo Digital Twin - ChatGPT Actions Integration

This directory contains the configuration for integrating Douglas Mo's Digital Twin with ChatGPT via GPT Actions. This allows users to interact with Douglas's professional profile directly through ChatGPT's interface.

## üìã Overview

ChatGPT Actions enable custom GPTs to call external APIs, allowing Douglas's Digital Twin to be accessed conversationally through ChatGPT. Users can ask natural language questions about Douglas's experience, skills, projects, and more.

## üéØ Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about Douglas's professional background
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access work experience, technical skills, project portfolio, and interview prep materials
- **RAG-Powered**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate, contextual responses
- **Feedback Collection**: Submit ratings and comments to improve response quality
- **Quality Analytics**: Admin endpoint for analyzing performance and identifying gaps
- **Conversation Starters**: Pre-configured prompts for common queries

## üìÅ Files

- `openapi.json` - OpenAPI 3.1.0 schema defining the API endpoints
- `actions-config.json` - ChatGPT Actions configuration with metadata and conversation starters
- `README.md` - This setup and usage guide

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy the API

Ensure your digital twin API is deployed and accessible at:
```
https://douglasmo.vercel.app
```

The following endpoints must be available:
- `POST /api/chat` - Main chat interface
- `GET /api/feedback` - Retrieve feedback history
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback
- `GET /api/quality-improvement` - Quality analysis (admin)

### 2. Host the OpenAPI Schema

The OpenAPI schema must be publicly accessible. Two options:

**Option A: Serve from your Next.js app**

Add a route to serve the schema:

```typescript
// app/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import openapiSchema from '@/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json(openapiSchema, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    },
  });
}
```

**Option B: Host on GitHub/CDN**

Upload `openapi.json` to a public location:
- GitHub raw file URL
- CDN like Cloudflare Pages
- Object storage like AWS S3

### 3. Create Custom GPT in ChatGPT

1. **Go to ChatGPT** ‚Üí Click your profile ‚Üí "My GPTs" ‚Üí "Create a GPT"

2. **Configure Basic Settings**:
   - **Name**: Douglas Mo Digital Twin
   - **Description**: Chat with Douglas Mo's AI-powered digital twin to learn about his professional experience, technical skills, and project portfolio.
   - **Instructions**:
   ```
   You are Douglas Mo's digital twin assistant. Your role is to help users learn about Douglas's professional background by querying his comprehensive profile data.

   When users ask questions:
   1. Use the queryDigitalTwin action to search Douglas's profile
   2. Present information clearly and professionally
   3. Highlight key achievements and quantifiable results
   4. If sources are provided, mention which aspects of his profile informed the answer
   5. Suggest relevant follow-up questions based on the conversation

   Guidelines:
   - Be professional and authentic to Douglas's voice
   - Emphasize concrete achievements and metrics
   - Use technical terminology appropriately when discussing skills
   - For career/interview questions, provide structured, actionable advice
   - Encourage users to submit feedback after responses

   When discussing:
   - TECHNICAL SKILLS: Mention specific technologies, proficiency levels, and projects
   - WORK EXPERIENCE: Focus on impact, achievements, and quantifiable results
   - PROJECTS: Highlight technologies used, problems solved, and outcomes
   - INTERVIEW PREP: Provide structured answers (STAR format when relevant)
   ```

3. **Configure Actions**:
   - Click "Create new action"
   - **Authentication**: None (or configure if you add API keys)
   - **Schema**: Import from URL or paste the contents of `openapi.json`
   - **URL**: `https://douglasmo.vercel.app/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json`
   - Click "Test" to verify the schema loads correctly

4. **Add Conversation Starters**:
   Copy these from `actions-config.json` or create your own:
   - "What is your experience with Python and machine learning?"
   - "Tell me about your most impressive project achievements"
   - "What was your role and impact at BF Suma?"
   - "How should I introduce myself in an interview?"

5. **Upload Logo** (Optional):
   - Create a 512x512 image representing Douglas's brand
   - Upload in the GPT configuration

6. **Set Additional Settings**:
   - **Capabilities**: Enable "Web Browsing" if you want to allow external searches

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before publishing your GPT, test these scenarios:

- [ ] **Basic Chat**: Ask a general question about Douglas
- [ ] **Technical Skills**: Query specific technologies (Python, React, etc.)
- [ ] **Work Experience**: Ask about specific companies or roles
- [ ] **Projects**: Request project details and achievements
- [ ] **Interview Prep**: Test behavioral question responses
- [ ] **Feedback Submission**: Submit a rating and verify it's recorded
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test with invalid/edge case queries
- [ ] **Follow-up Questions**: Verify conversation continuity
- [ ] **Source Attribution**: Check that sources are mentioned
- [ ] **Response Quality**: Ensure answers are accurate and professional

## üé® Customization Options

### Modify Conversation Starters

Edit `actions-config.json` to change default prompts:

```json
"conversation_starters": [
  {
    "text": "Your custom prompt here",
    "category": "your_category"
  }
]
```

### Add Authentication (Optional)

If you want to restrict API access:

1. **Update `openapi.json`**:
```json
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "apiKey": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "header",
      "name": "X-API-Key"
    }
  }
},
"security": [{"apiKey": []}]
```

2. **Update `actions-config.json`**:
```json
"auth": {
  "type": "service_http",
  "authorization_type": "bearer",
  "custom_auth_header": "X-API-Key",
  "verification_tokens": {
    "openai": "your-verification-token"
  }
}
```

3. **Implement API key validation in your Next.js API routes**

### Enhance with Additional Endpoints

Add new capabilities by:
1. Creating new API routes in your Next.js app
2. Adding them to `openapi.json` under `paths`
3. Updating GPT instructions to use new actions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Schema validation fails

**Solution**: Validate your OpenAPI schema at [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
- Copy `openapi.json` contents
- Paste into editor
- Fix any validation errors

### Issue: API calls return 404

**Check**:
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment is live
- ‚úÖ Routes are correctly defined in Next.js app
- ‚úÖ URLs in `openapi.json` match your deployment URL

### Issue: GPT doesn't use actions

**Solution**:
- Improve GPT instructions to explicitly mention when to use actions
- Test with more direct queries
- Check action configuration in GPT settings

### Issue: Responses are generic/not using profile data

**Solution**:
- Verify your `/api/chat` endpoint is actually querying the vector database
- Check that `digitaltwin.json` is properly loaded
- Test the endpoint directly with Postman/curl

### Issue: Feedback not being recorded

**Check**:
- ‚úÖ Redis connection is working (if using Redis)
- ‚úÖ `/api/feedback` POST route accepts correct schema
- ‚úÖ Response includes `success: true`

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

Track GPT usage and performance:

1. **Query Logs**: Monitor `/api/chat` requests in Vercel logs
2. **Feedback Trends**: Analyze feedback with `/api/quality-improvement`
3. **Error Rates**: Watch for failed requests in deployment logs
4. **Popular Queries**: Identify common topics from query logs
5. **Response Times**: Monitor API performance in Vercel analytics

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure latest code is deployed
   git add chatgpt-actions/
   git commit -m "Add ChatGPT Actions configuration"
   git push origin main
   
   # Vercel will auto-deploy
   ```

2. **Create Custom GPT**: Follow setup instructions above

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Use testing checklist before publishing

4. **Share with Recruiters**: Provide GPT link as part of your application materials

5. **Gather Feedback**: Monitor feedback API and improve profile data based on insights

6. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on user interactions and feedback
