# ChatGPT Actions Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

This guide will help you deploy Douglas Mo's Digital Twin as a ChatGPT Custom GPT.

### Prerequisites

‚úÖ ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise account (required for GPT Actions)  
‚úÖ Digital Twin API deployed at `https://douglasmo.vercel.app`  
‚úÖ OpenAPI schema file accessible

---

## Step 1: Serve the OpenAPI Schema

You need to make `openapi.json` publicly accessible. Choose one option:

### Option A: Add API Route to Next.js (Recommended)

Create a new file: `app/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import openapiSchema from '@/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json(openapiSchema, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600',
    },
  });
}
```

Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
git add app/chatgpt-actions/
git commit -m "Add OpenAPI schema endpoint for ChatGPT Actions"
git push origin main
```

Verify it works:
```bash
curl https://douglasmo.vercel.app/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json
```

### Option B: Host on GitHub Pages

1. Push `chatgpt-actions/` folder to a public GitHub repo
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
3. Access at: `https://yourusername.github.io/digital-twin/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json`

## Step 2: Create Custom GPT

### 2.1 Go to GPT Builder

1. Open ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com
2. Click your profile picture (bottom left)
3. Select **"My GPTs"**
4. Click **"Create a GPT"**

### 2.2 Configure in "Create" Tab

Use the assistant to set up basics:

**Prompt:**
```
Create a GPT named "Douglas Mo Digital Twin" that helps users learn about Douglas Mo's professional background. It should query an external API to provide accurate information about his work experience, technical skills, project portfolio, and interview preparation materials. The tone should be professional and authentic to Douglas's voice.
```

Let the assistant generate initial configuration, then switch to "Configure" tab.

### 2.3 Configure in "Configure" Tab

---

## Step 5: Monitor & Improve

### Track Usage

Monitor API calls in Vercel:
```
Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Filter by "/api/chat"
```

### Analyze Feedback

Check quality metrics:
```bash
curl https://douglasmo.vercel.app/api/feedback?limit=100
```

Or use the quality improvement endpoint:
```bash
curl https://douglasmo.vercel.app/api/quality-improvement?format=summary
```

### Iterate on Instructions

Based on user interactions:
1. Go to GPT settings ‚Üí Configure
2. Update Instructions to improve responses
3. Add new conversation starters
4. Refine tone and formatting

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Actions schema validation failed"

**Solution:**
1. Validate OpenAPI schema at https://editor.swagger.io/
2. Copy `chatgpt-actions/openapi.json` contents
3. Paste into Swagger Editor
4. Fix any validation errors
5. Update the schema in GPT settings

### Issue: "Unable to fetch schema from URL"

**Check:**
- ‚úÖ URL is publicly accessible (test in browser)
- ‚úÖ Returns valid JSON
- ‚úÖ Has CORS headers enabled
- ‚úÖ HTTPS (not HTTP)

**Test with curl:**
```bash
curl -I https://douglasmo.vercel.app/chatgpt-actions/openapi.json
```

Should return:
```
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
access-control-allow-origin: *
```

### Issue: GPT gives generic answers without calling API

**Solution:**
1. Update Instructions to be more explicit about using actions
2. Add trigger phrases like "query Douglas's profile" 
3. Test with more direct questions
4. Check that action is enabled in settings

### Issue: API returns 404 or errors

**Verify endpoints exist:**
```bash
# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST https://douglasmo.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are your Python skills?"}'

# Test feedback endpoint
curl https://douglasmo.vercel.app/api/feedback?limit=10
```

### Issue: Responses lack detail or accuracy

**Check:**
1. Is vector database properly initialized? Run `npm run init:vectors`
2. Is `digitaltwin.json` comprehensive?
3. Are embeddings up to date?
4. Test `/api/chat` directly to verify data quality

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Add API Key Authentication

1. **Generate API key** (any secure random string)

2. **Update OpenAPI schema** (`openapi.json`):
```json
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "apiKey": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "header",
      "name": "X-API-Key"
    }
  }
},
"security": [{"apiKey": []}]
```

3. **Update GPT Actions settings**:
- Authentication: API Key
- API Key: `your-generated-key`
- Auth Type: Custom
- Custom Header Name: `X-API-Key`

4. **Validate in Next.js API routes**:
```typescript
const apiKey = request.headers.get('X-API-Key');
if (apiKey !== process.env.API_KEY) {
  return NextResponse.json({error: 'Unauthorized'}, {status: 401});
}
```

### Add Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse:

```typescript
// lib/rate-limit.ts
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';

export async function rateLimit(identifier: string, limit = 100, window = 3600) {
  const redis = Redis.fromEnv();
  const key = `ratelimit:${identifier}`;
  const count = await redis.incr(key);
  
  if (count === 1) {
    await redis.expire(key, window);
  }
  
  return count <= limit;
}
```

Use in API routes:
```typescript
const allowed = await rateLimit(request.headers.get('X-API-Key') || 'anonymous');
if (!allowed) {
  return NextResponse.json({error: 'Rate limit exceeded'}, {status: 429});
}
```

### Add Analytics Dashboard

Create admin page to view GPT usage:

```typescript
// app/admin/gpt-analytics/page.tsx
import { getFeedback } from '@/lib/redis-analytics';

export default async function GPTAnalytics() {
  const feedback = await getFeedback(1000);
  const chatGptQueries = feedback.filter(f => 
    f.userAgent?.includes('ChatGPT') || f.source === 'chatgpt'
  );
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>ChatGPT Actions Analytics</h1>
      <div>Total Queries: {chatGptQueries.length}</div>
      <div>Avg Rating: {calculateAverage(chatGptQueries)}</div>
      {/* More analytics */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
